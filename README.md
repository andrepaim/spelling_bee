# Spelling Bee Trainer

Welcome to the Spelling Bee Trainer! 

This is a very simple web app designed to help my son prepare for his school spelling competition. 

The Spelling Bee Trainer uses a list of words provided by the school.

You can access the web app directly [here](https://andrepaim.github.io/spelling_bee).
