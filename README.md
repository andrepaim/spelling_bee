# Spelling Bee Trainer

Welcome to the Spelling Bee Trainer! 

This is a very simple web app designed to help my son prepare for his school spelling competition. 

The Spelling Bee Trainer uses a list of words provided by the school.

You can access the web app directly [here](https://andrepaim.github.io/spelling_bee).

## Project Structure
The project consists of a simple HTML/Javascript file that runs the main application, and a text file that stores the words to be practiced.

- `index.html` - The main HTML/Javascript file that hosts the web app.
- `words.txt` - The text file containing the spelling words provided by the school.
